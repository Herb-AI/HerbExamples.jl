# HerbExamples.jl

This repository contains some examples of Herb.jl usages.
If you want to run the Jupyter notebook files, you first need to install [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).
You can then get Jupyter notebook to work with Julia by installing the IJulia package [using Pkg](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).
You should be able to run the Jupyter notebook files directly after installing the package.
