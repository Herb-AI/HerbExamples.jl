# HerbExamples.jl

This repository contains some examples of Herb.jl usages and uses notebooks for demonstrations of how to use the Herb Program Synthesis Framework. 

If you want to run the Jupyter notebook files, you first need to install [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).
You can then get Jupyter notebook to work with Julia by installing the IJulia package [using Pkg](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).
You should be able to run the Jupyter notebook files directly after installing the package.

## Contents

1. **Search**: this notebook is a simple example of how to use Herb. We define a very simple Grammar, create a few examples and explain how the search function works to find candidate programs.
2. **Grammars**: this notebook elaborates on how to construct different types of grammars.
